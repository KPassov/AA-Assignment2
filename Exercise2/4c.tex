\paragraph{c}
We wish to compute the following.
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{|S^{k}_{n}(A) \cap S^{k}_{n}(B) \cap S^{k}_{n}(S^{k}_{n}(A) \cup S^{k}_{n}(B))|}{k}
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$S^{k}_{n}(A)$} The first instance takes $O(k)$ as we wish to take the k first values of A, the second can be done in constant time.
    \item{$S^{k}_{n}(B)$} Will be the same as above, so $O(k)$.
    \item{$\cap$} can be done in $O(k)$. 
    \item{$\cup$} Here we have to hash the values of A and B followed by comparing each element of the lists from the top. We get a runtime of $k * h(x)$.
\end{itemize}
The largest runtime here is $O(k \cdot h(x))$, so that would be our runtime.
